# Collections System

> 📁 **Context:** [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) | [CodingStandards.md](CodingStandards.md)

## TL;DR

✅ **v0.0 MVP COMPLETE**: Collections feature fully implemented. Users can organize Glamourer designs by user-defined categories. Collections map to Glamourer folder paths and/or Glamourer tags, data persists in Configuration, and UI tabs switch between collections. Supports uncategorized designs (no folder), multiple folder paths per collection, and comma-separated tag matching.

✅ Data model and persistence working
✅ Service layer with full CRUD operations
✅ UI tabs for collection navigation
✅ Modal editor for creating/editing collections
✅ Gallery filtering by selected collection
✅ Right-click context menu for Edit/Delete
✅ Graceful error handling

## Original Plan (Reference)

### Phase 1: Data Model & Persistence (Parallel operations possible)

1. **Create Collection data model** — Add `Collection.cs` class with properties: `Id` (Guid), `Name` (string), `FolderPaths` (List<string>), `IsActive` (bool), `Order` (int). Should be serializable for Configuration.

2. **Update Configuration** — Add `Collections` (List<Collection>) property to [Configuration.cs](Configuration.cs). Increment Version. Add migration logic if needed for future updates.

3. **Create CollectionService** — New file `Services/CollectionService.cs` with methods:
   - `GetCollections()` — returns all collections
   - `CreateCollection(name, folderPaths)` — returns new collection
   - `DeleteCollection(id)` — removes collection
   - `UpdateCollection(id, name, folderPaths)` — updates collection
   - `GetDesignsByCollection(collectionId)` — filters designs from GlamourerService by folder paths
   - Each method persists changes to Configuration via `Configuration.Save()`

### Phase 2: UI Update (Depends on Phase 1)

4. **Add collection tabs to MainWindow** — Create tab bar above gallery area using ImGui TabBar/TabItem. Display all collections with "+" button to add new. *Depends on Phase 1.*

5. **Create CollectionEditor UI** — New file `Windows/CollectionEditorWindow.cs` (or modal in MainWindow) with:
   - Text input for collection name
   - Checkboxes or multi-select for available Glamourer folder paths (retrieve from GetDesignListExtended by extracting unique paths)
   - Save/Cancel buttons
   - *Depends on Phase 1.*

6. **Filter gallery by selected collection** — MainWindow stores `selectedCollectionId`, passes to GlamourerService.GetDesignsByCollection(), displays filtered results. *Depends on Phase 2.4.*

### Phase 3: Integration & Refinement (Depends on Phase 2)

7. **Display folder list** — Parse unique folder paths from Glamourer designs on first launch, populate UI for collection setup. Uses GetDesignListExtended data already fetched.

8. **Error handling** — Handle cases where collection is deleted but still referenced (graceful fallback to first collection or "All Designs").

## Relevant files

- [Configuration.cs](Configuration.cs) — Add `Collections` property
- `Services/CollectionService.cs` (NEW) — Collection CRUD & filtering logic
- [Windows/MainWindow.cs](Windows/MainWindow.cs) — Add tab bar, collection filtering
- `Windows/CollectionEditorWindow.cs` (NEW) — Collection creation/editing UI
- [Services/GlamourerService.cs](Services/GlamourerService.cs) — Already has design list with paths

## Verification

1. **Unit/manual tests**: Create a collection, verify it persists after restart
2. **Filter test**: Add designs to collection with specific folder path, verify gallery shows only those
3. **UI test**: Tabs render correctly, adding/deleting collections updates UI
4. **Edge case**: Delete collection while active — should fallback gracefully

## Decisions

- Collections stored in plugin Configuration (simple, lightweight, no separate DB)
- Folder paths matched as string prefixes (e.g., "SFW/Dresses" matches designs in that folder)
- Collections are soft-linked to Glamourer folders — no modification to Glamourer needed
- Collections filter by folder path and/or Glamourer tags (union match)
- Default collection "All Designs" always available (optional, can be skipped for now)

## Implementation Status

✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETED** — The Collections system is fully implemented and functional.

## Task Breakdown

### TASK 1: Create Collection Data Model
**Objective**: Create the `Collection.cs` class that will hold collection data  
**Details**:
- Create new file: `Vestiary/Models/Collection.cs`
- Properties: `Id` (Guid), `Name` (string), `FolderPaths` (List<string>), `Order` (int)
- Make it `[Serializable]` for Configuration persistence
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: Collection.cs created with parameterless and convenience constructors for deserialization

### TASK 2: Update Configuration (depends on Task 1)
**Objective**: Add Collections collection to persistent config  
**Details**:
- Update [Configuration.cs](Configuration.cs): add `public List<Collection> Collections { get; set; }` 
- Increment `Version` from 0 to 1
- Initialize default collections list
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: Configuration.cs now includes `Collections` list initialized to empty, Version incremented to 1

### TASK 3: Create CollectionService (depends on Task 1-2)
**Objective**: Service layer for Collection CRUD operations  
**Details**:
- Create `Services/CollectionService.cs`
- Methods needed: `GetCollections()`, `CreateCollection()`, `UpdateCollection()`, `DeleteCollection()`, `GetDesignsByCollection()`
- Each method updates Configuration.Save()
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: All CRUD methods implemented. GetDesignsByCollection() supports both regular collections (prefix-matching paths) and uncategorized collections (designs with no "/" in path)

### TASK 4: Extract Unique Folder Paths from Glamourer
**Objective**: Get available folder paths to show in UI  
**Details**:
- Add method to GlamourerService: `GetUniqueFolderPaths()` 
- Extract from existing `GetDesignList()` data
- Return List<string>
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: GetUniqueFolderPaths() added and returns sorted, distinct folder paths from all Glamourer designs

### TASK 5: Add Collection Tabs to MainWindow (depends on Task 1-3)
**Objective**: UI for switching between collections  
**Details**:
- Update [Windows/MainWindow.cs](Windows/MainWindow.cs)
- Add ImGui tab bar for collections
- Add "+" button to create new
- Store selected collection ID
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: Tab bar renders all collections, "+" button opens CollectionEditorWindow for creating new collections. Includes right-click context menu for Edit/Delete operations

### TASK 6: Create CollectionEditor (depends on Task 1-4)
**Objective**: UI for creating/editing collections  
**Details**:
- Create `Windows/CollectionEditorWindow.cs`
- Input for collection name
- Multi-line text input for folder paths (one per line)
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: CollectionEditorWindow.cs created with text-based UI. Users enter collection name, folder paths as a newline-separated list, and tags as a comma-separated list. Window uses 550x500 size with live design count feedback.

### TASK 7: Filter Gallery by Collection (depends on Task 5)
**Objective**: Show only designs in selected collection  
**Details**:
- Get selected collection from tabs
- Call CollectionService.GetDesignsByCollection()
- Display filtered results
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: MainWindow displays design count for selected collection with full gallery rendering.

### TASK 8: Error Handling (depends on all)
**Objective**: Handle edge cases gracefully  
**Details**:
- Deleted collection fallback
- Path validation
- Uncategorized collection support
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Implementation: Deleted collections trigger fallback to first collection or Guid.Empty. Validation prevents empty collection names. Empty paths create "Uncategorized" collections showing designs with no folders. Try-catch in MainWindow shows error message if Glamourer unavailable

## Implementation Decisions (Finalized)

1. **Folder path matching**: **Prefix match (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - Design FullPath must start with one of the collection's folder paths
   - Example: Collection with path "SFW/Dresses" matches "SFW/Dresses/AM - Jaque Bridesmaid"

2. **Multiple folder paths per collection**: **1:N (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - Collections support multiple folder paths
   - Example: "Dresses" collection can contain both "SFW/Dresses" and "NSFW/Dresses"
   - Users enter paths as newline-separated text in CollectionEditorWindow

3. **Uncategorized support**: **IMPLEMENTED**
   - Collections with empty folder paths and empty tags show only root-level designs (designs without any "/" in FullPath)
   - Example: "Spring Shirt - Caroline Towel" appears in uncategorized
   - Example: "SFW/Dresses/AM - Jaque Bridesmaid" does NOT appear in uncategorized

4. **Initial folder discovery**: **Manual entry (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - Users manually enter collection names and paths
   - No auto-discovery UI (can be added in future if needed)

5. **UI approach for path entry**: **Text-based (NOT checkboxes)**
   - Users paste or type folder paths in a multi-line text input
   - Supports copying/pasting multiple paths at once
   - More flexible than checkbox selection
